- 👋 Hi, I'm @M.T I'm fairly new to the entire Github experience so and am a strong believe in being self-taught so I am ask a million questions lol. 

- 👀 I’m interested in anything digital media or anything that involves websites, music, and network infastructure.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning my normal 9-5 work involves building trades and music production, however I'm currently learning web design/development, android app development, graphic design, digital marketing, and web hosting through privately owned and operated servers and SaS systems.
- 
  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any one of the topics I just listed, in fact if anyone is looking to learn the art of audio recording and production I'd be more than happy to depart some technical know-hows and tips.
